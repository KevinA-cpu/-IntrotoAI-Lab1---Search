This is a small project demonstrating how a searching algorithm looks like using py-game
This project was created for a university assignment the subject was "Introduction to AI"
The algorithms include:
- DFS
- BFS
- UCS
- Dijkstra
- A Star

Run using main.py with the following parameters
--algo UCS/DFS/BFS/Dijkstra/AStar: choose the algorithm you want to run
--start 71 : set the starting position
--goal 318 :set the goal position

Constant.py contains the color for the components of the graphs
Space.py is the code for the graphs and nodes

This source code is only for referencing purpose, the publisher did not write everything, only the implementation of the algorithms.
